WIP convert doxx to webpack.

Current issue is using loading handlebars-helpers with handlebars-loader.

Steps:

[ ] - Smart imports.. hmmmmmmm.
[ ] - loader helpers
[ ] - respect $ref path
[x] - extract front matter
[ ] - use front matter to export multiple pages for dynamic pages
[ ] - use react for templates

Qs:

Do we need nav.json? can't we use 'fs' as routing system for docs?
